          <strong>$Mustard</strong> is the Glizzyverse utility token and
          essential for whatâ€™s to come! Why?
          <br />
          <br />
          Because 1 $Mustard = 1 $Mustard. Not available to trade or buy, only
          obtainable through holding your Glizzys. Each Glizzy generates 5
          $Mustard per day, passive yield, no staking, and able to claim at any
          time.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What's to come?</strong>
          <br /> You will be able to burn your $Mustard to breed Weenie Warriors
          and soon to mint your Voxel Glizzys!
