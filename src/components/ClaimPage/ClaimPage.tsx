          <strong>$Mustard</strong> is the Glizzyverse utility token and
          essential for whatâ€™s to come! Why?
          <br />
          <br />
          Because 1 $Mustard = 1 $Mustard. Not available to trade or buy, only
          obtainable through holding your Glizzys. Each Glizzy generates 5
          $Mustard per day, passive yield, no staking, and able to claim at any
          time.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What's to come?</strong> You will be able to burn your
          $Mustard for Weenie Warriors, Voxels and if you have a trait you don't
          like, for a trait exchange!
